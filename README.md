# Campus Map Navigation

Developed a console app that uses Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the shortest weighted path between given start and end points to help a user navigate through the UIC campus.
Loaded maps from OpenStreetMap and parsed XML files to locate and compute nodes, footways and buildings.
